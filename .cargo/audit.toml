# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa crate timing sidechannel vulnerability
# Status: No fix available
# This is a transitive dependency from sqlx-mysql (via sea-orm's sqlx feature).
# Since this project uses PostgreSQL (not MySQL), this vulnerability does not
# affect the application. Ignoring until an upstream fix is available.
