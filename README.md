> **See your PRs at a glance.** Ampel brings traffic light simplicity to PR management across GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Ampel (German for "traffic light") is a unified PR dashboard that consolidates pull requests from multiple Git providers into a single interface, using an intuitive traffic light system to show what's ready to merge, what's in progress, and what's blocked.

## Why Ampel?

- 🎯 **Stop Context-Switching** - No more jumping between GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Everything in one dashboard.
- ⚡ **Instant Visibility** - Traffic light status (🟢 Green = ready, 🟡 Yellow = in progress, 🔴 Red = blocked) cuts through the noise.
- 🚀 **Production-Ready** - Battle-tested observability stack with Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and comprehensive monitoring.
- 🔒 **Self-Hosted & Secure** - Deploy on your infrastructure with AES-256-GCM encrypted PAT storage. No data leaves your control.
- 🤝 **Team-First Design** - Organizations, teams, bulk merge operations, and health scores for managing repos at scale.

## Quick Start

**With Docker (fastest path to value):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pacphi/ampel.git
cd ampel && cp .env.example .env
cd docker && docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect your first repository.

**That's it.** You'll have a fully functional PR dashboard with monitoring stack in under 5 minutes.
